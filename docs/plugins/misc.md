# Miscellaneous stuff

This section contains some odds and ends that were not discussed in
previous sections.

## Plugin initialization

Plugins are initialized when Slack Machine starts. Because the
[`MachineBasePlugin`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin]
already has a constructor that is used to pass various
things to the plugin instance at startup, it is advised not to provide a
constructor for your plugin.

If your plugin needs to initialize its own things at startup, you can
override the [`init()`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin.init] method.
This method will be called once when the plugin is
initialized. It is no-op by default.

## Plugin help information

You can provide help text for your plugin and its commands by adding
[docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) to your plugin
class and its methods. The first line of the docstring of a plugin class
will be used for grouping help information of plugin methods. This even
extends beyond one class, ie. if multiple plugin classes have the same
docstring (first line), the help information for the methods under those
classes will be grouped together.

The first line of the docstring of each plugin method can be used for
specifying help information for that specific function. It should be in
the format `command: help text`.

The `machine.plugins.builtin.help.HelpPlugin` (enabled by default) will
provide Slack users with the help information described above.
