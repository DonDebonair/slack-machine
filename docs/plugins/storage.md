# Storage

Slack Machine provides persistent storage that can easily be accessed
from plugins through `self.storage`. This field contains an instance of
[`PluginStorage`][machine.storage.PluginStorage],
which lets you store, retrieve and remove values by key, check for the
existence of a key and get information about the current size of the
underlying storage.

The [`PluginStorage`][machine.storage.PluginStorage]
class interfaces with whatever storage backend Slack Machine is
configured with. You can read more about the available storage backends
in the [user guide][choosing-storage].

Example:

``` python
@respond_to(r"store (?P<text>.*) under (?P<key>\w+)")
def store(self, msg, text, key):
    self.storage.set(key, text)
    msg.say("'{}' stored under {}!".format(text, key))

@respond_to(r"retrieve (?P<key>\w+)")
def retrieve(self, msg, key):
    data = self.storage.get(key)
    if data:
        msg.say("'{}' retrieved from <{}>!".format(data, key))
    else:
        msg.say("Key not found!")

@respond_to(r"delete (?P<key>\w+)")
def delete(self, msg, key):
    self.storage.delete(key)
    msg.say("data in <{}> deleted!".format(key))

@respond_to(r"does (?P<key>\w+) exist?")
def exists(self, msg, key):
    # if key in self.storage
    if self.storage.has(key):
        msg.say("<{}> exists.".format(key))
    else:
        msg.say("<{}> does not exist!".format(key))

@respond_to(r"size")
def size(self, msg):
    human_size = self.storage.get_storage_size_human()
    msg.say("storage size: {}".format(human_size))
```

## Shared vs non-shared

By default, when you store, retrieve and remove data by key, Slack
Machine will automatically namespace the keys you use with the fully
qualified classname of the plugin the storage is used from. This is done
to prevent plugins from changing or even deleting each others data. So
when you do this:

``` python
class MyPlugin:
# resides in module my.plugin.package

def some_function():
    self.set('my-key', 'my-data')
```

Slack Machine will send the key `my.plugin.package.MyPlugin:my-key` to
the storage backend.

You can override this behaviour by setting the `shared` parameter to
`True` when calling a storage related function that requires a key as
parameter. This keep the key global (ie. non-namespaced). This is useful
when you want to share data between plugins. Use this feature with care
though, as you can destroy data that belongs to other plugins!

## Implementing your own storage backend

You can implement your own storage backend by subclassing
[`MachineBaseStorage`][machine.storage.backends.base.MachineBaseStorage].
You only have to implement a couple of methods, and you
don't have to take care of namespacing of keys, as Slack Machine will
do that for you.
