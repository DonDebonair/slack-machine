# Plugin Settings

All settings that are defined, either from the Slack Machine defaults or
in `local_settings.py` are available to plugins through the
`self.settings` field. This is a dictionary with all settings indexed by
their name. Next to `local_settings.py`, users can also specify settings
with environment variables. Slack Machine will automatically translate
any environment variable with the format `SM_<SETTING-NAME>` to a
setting with name `SETTING-NAME`, overriding a setting with the same
name from `local_settings.py` or the default settings.

So an environment variable `SM_SLACK_API_TOKEN` will result in a setting
`SLACK_API_TOKEN`.

Setting names are **case insensitive**.

## Example of using settings

When the `local_settings.py` looks like this:

``` python
SLACK_API_TOKEN = 'xoxo-abc123'
GREETING_PLUGIN_MY_GREETING = 'Bonjour'
```

This can be used in a plugin, like this:

``` python
@respond_to(r"Hello!")
def greeting(self, msg):
    msg.reply("{}, {}!".format(
        self.settings['GREETING_PLUGIN_MY_GREETING'],
        msg.at_sender
    ))
```

The respond to a message *\@superbot Hello!\"* from **\@john**, in this
case would be: *Bonjour, \@john!*

## Required settings

If your plugin requires one or more settings to be defined in order to
work, you can mark them as *required* with the
[`@required_settings`][machine.plugins.decorators.required_settings] decorator. This decorator takes a string or a list of
strings as argument which can be one or more settings that are required
by your plugin. Upon startup, Slack Machine will check if any of the
settings that are marked as *required* by a plugin, have not been
defined by the user. If it finds one or more missing settings, it will
not load that particular plugin, and notify the user which settings are
missing.

The [`@required_settings`][machine.plugins.decorators.required_settings] decorator can be applied to a plugin class and/or its
methods. Note that if **any** of the required settings are missing, the
plugin will not load as a whole, so none of the methods will be
registered.

Example:

``` python
@required_settings(['TODO_SERVICE_USERNAME', 'TODO_SERVICE_PASSWORD'])
class TodoPlugin(MachineBasePlugin):
    ...
```
