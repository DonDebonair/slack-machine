# Listening for things

Slack Machine allows you to listen for various different things and
respond to that. By decorating functions in your plugin using the
`decorators-section` Slack Machine
provides, you can tell Slack Machine to run those functions when
something specific happens.

## Listen for a mention

The [`respond_to`][machine.plugins.decorators.respond_to]
decorator tells Slack Machine to listen for messages
mentioning your bot and matching a specific pattern. Slack Machine will
hear messages sent in any channel or private group it is a member of.
For a message to trigger a function decorated by `@respond_to(...)`, the
message has to *start* with a mention of your bot or with any alias the
user configured using the `ALIASES` setting. The exception is direct
messages sent to the bot, they don't have to include a mention to
trigger `@respond_to`.

`@respond_to` takes 2 parameters:

:   **regex** (_required_): the regular expression Slack Machine should
    listen for. The regex pattern should **not** account for the mention
    of your bot, as Slack Machine will remove the mention before looking
    for a match. Slack Machine listens for any occurrence of the pattern
    in the message, so if you want to specifically match the whole
    message, you can anchor your pattern using the `^` and `$` symbols.

:   **flags** (optional): can be used to pass flags for the regex matching
    as defined in the [`re`][re] module. By default, [`re.IGNORECASE`][re.IGNORECASE] is applied.

### How your function will be called

Your function will be called with a [`Message`][machine.plugins.base.Message]
object that represents the message that triggered the function. It not
only contains the message text itself, but also has many convenient
methods for replying.

Example:

``` python
@respond_to(r"^I love you")
def spread_love(self, msg):
    msg.reply("I love you too!")
```

The regex pattern can optionally contain [named groups](http://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html)
that will be captured and passed to your function as keyword arguments.

Example:

``` python
@respond_to(r"You deserve (?P<num_stars>\d+) stars!")
def award(self, msg, num_stars):
    stars_back = int(num_stars) + 1
    msg.reply("Well, you deserve {}!".format(stars_back))
```

## Hear any message

The [`@listen_to`][machine.plugins.decorators.listen_to] decorator works similar as the
[`@respond_to`][machine.plugins.decorators.respond_to] decorator, but it will hear *any* message matching a
pattern, without the bot being explicitly mentioned. `@listen_to` takes
the same parameters as `@respond_to`.

Example:

``` python
@listen_to(r"go for it")
@listen_to(r"go 4 it")
def go_for_it(self, msg):
    msg.say("https://a-z-animals.com/media/animals/images/original/gopher_2.jpg")
```

As you can see, you can also apply the same decorator multiple times to
a function, each time with different arguments. Of course, you can also
combine different decorators on one function.

## More flexibility with Slack events

If you want your bot to respond to other things than messages, you can
do so using the [`@process`][machine.plugins.decorators.process]
decorator. `@process` requires an `event_type` as parameter and will
trigger the decorated function any time an event of the specified type
happens. It can listen to any [Slack event](https://api.slack.com/events) that is supported by the RTM API.

The received event will be passed to your function.

The following example will listen for the
[reaction_added](https://api.slack.com/events/reaction_added) event to
know if a *reaction* was added to a message, and will match that
reaction:

``` python
@process("reaction_added")
def match_reaction(self, event):
    emoji = event['reaction']
    channel = event['item']['channel']
    ts = event['item']['ts']
    self.react(channel, ts, emoji)
```

As you can see, `@process` gives you a lot of flexibility by allowing
you to process any event Slack Machine does not provide a specific
decorator for.

## Take action on a Schedule

Slack Machine can also run functions on a schedule, using the
[`@schedule`][machine.plugins.decorators.schedule] decorator.
`@schedule` behaves like Linux/Unix [Crontab](http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference),
and receives similar parameters. You can specify on what schedule your
function should be called. When your function is called, it will not
receive any arguments except `self`, but you can of course call any
[`MachineBasePlugin`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin] methods
to send message and do other things.

Example:

``` python
@schedule(hour='9-17', minute='*/30')
def movement_reminder(self):
    self.say('general',
             '<!here> maybe now is a good time to take a short walk!')
```

## Events

Slack Machine can respond to events that are emitted by your plugin(s)
or plugins of others, or events generated by parts of Slack Machine
itself. You can use the [`@on`][machine.plugins.decorators.on]
decorator on a function to run that function whenever a certain event is
emitted somewhere.

Example:

``` python
@on('bathroom_used')
def call_cleaning_department(self, **kwargs):
    self.say('cleaning-department', '<!here> Somebody used the toilet!')
```

This function will be called whenever the `bathroom_used` event is
emitted somewhere.


!!! important "Some things to be aware of"

    Event names are global, every plugin can emit and listen for the same
    events. This is by design, because this way, you can use events to
    exchange data between plugins. Events can be a way to expose a
    "public API" for plugins. But this can also mean your functions are
    unexpectedly triggered by events sent by other plugins, especially if
    the event names you choose are very generic.

    When emitting events, plugins can attach whatever variables they want
    to the event, and when listening for an event, your function will be
    called with whatever arguments were attached to the event when the
    event was emitted. It's therefor a good idea to always include
    `**kwargs` as a catch-all, otherwise your function could return an
    error when it's called with arguments that have not been explicitly
    defined.

You can read [emitting events][emitting-events] to learn how to emit events from your plugins.

## HTTP Listener

Slack Machine has a built-in HTTP server that can listen for incoming
requests. [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org) is used for this feature. You
can use the [`@route`][machine.plugins.decorators.route] decorator to mark
functions in your plugin classes to listen for specific HTTP calls. The
decorator accepts the same arguments as the [Bottle route()](https://bottlepy.org/docs/0.12/api.html#bottle.route)
decorator. You can return anything that Bottle view functions can
return, because your functions will be delegated to the Bottle router.
You can of course also use any of the features that the
[`MachineBasePlugin`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin] gives you, such as
sending a message to a user or a channel.

Example:

``` python
@route("/hello")
@route("/hello/<name>")
def my_exposed_function(self, name="World"):
    self.say('my-channel', '{} is talking to me'.format(name))
    return {"hello": name}

# listen to specific HTTP verbs
@route("/status", method=["POST", "GET"])
def my_other_function(self):
    return {"status": "I'm a-okay!"}
```

Slack Machine supports any of the server backends that [Bottle
supports](https://bottlepy.org/docs/0.12/deployment.html#switching-the-server-backend).
You can set the name of the server backend you want in your settings as
`HTTP_SERVER_BACKEND`.

If you don't need this functionality, you can disable the HTTP server
by setting `DISABLE_HTTP` to `True` in your settings.

The built-in HTTP server which can be configured using the following
settings:

``` python
# Should the HTTP server be enabled?
DISABLE_HTTP = False

# Which serving backend should `bottle` use?
HTTP_SERVER_BACKEND = 'wsgiref'

# Host address to listen on
HTTP_SERVER_HOST = '0.0.0.0'

# Host port to listen on
HTTP_SERVER_PORT = 8080
```
