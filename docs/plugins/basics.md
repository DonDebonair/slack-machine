# Plugin Basics

Writing plugins for Slack Machine is easy. To show you *how* easy,
we'll build and run a simple plugin from start to finish. To be able to
follow this guide, you have to have [installed and configured][installation]
Slack Machine first!

## The Base class for plugins

Plugins in Slack Machine are classes that subclass
[`MachineBasePlugin`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin].
Inheriting from this class tells Slack Machine that
we're dealing with a plugin. But that's not even the most exciting
part! With this base class, your plugin immediately has a lot of
functionality at its disposal that makes it super easy to do anything
from talking to channels, responding to messages, sending DMs, and much
more!

## The decorators

Being able to talk in Slack is only half the story for plugins. The
functions in your plugin have to be triggered somehow. Slack Machine
provides [Decorators](../../api#decorators) for that.
You can decorate the functions in your plugin class to tell them what
they should react to.

As an example, let's create a cool plugin!

## Step 1: Creating the plugin

We're going to create a plugin that listens for [The
Answer](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/42), and responds in kind.

In the root of your bot (where your `local_settings.py` lives), create a
*plugins* folder. In it, create an `__init__.py` (so your *plugins*
folder becomes a package) and a file named `hitchhikers.py`.

Your folder structure should look like this:

``` bash
├── local_settings.py
└── plugins
    ├── __init__.py
    └── hitchhikers.py
```

## Step 2: Adding the code

First, we should import the
[`MachineBasePlugin`][machine.plugins.base.MachineBasePlugin]
in our code, and the decorator to listen for specific
messages. Then we can create our plugin class that includes a function
that listens for The Answer, and responds to it:

``` python
from machine.plugins.base import MachineBasePlugin
from machine.plugins.decorators import listen_to
import re

class UltimateQuestionPlugin(MachineBasePlugin):

    @listen_to(regex=r'^42$')
    def question(self, msg):
        msg.say("You're telling me the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, "
                "the Universe and Everything, but I don't know the question :cry:")
```

## Step 3: Enabling our plugin

Now we can enable our plugin in our configuration file. Your
`local_settings.py` should look like this:

``` python
SLACK_API_TOKEN = 'xoxb-something-something'

PLUGINS = ['machine.plugins.builtin.general.HelloPlugin',
           'machine.plugins.builtin.general.PingPongPlugin',
           'plugins.hitchhikers.UltimateQuestionPlugin']
```

## Step 4: Run that bot!

To run your bot with the new plugin:

``` bash
$ slack-machine
```

That's all there is to it!
