# Using Slack Machine

Once you have installed Slack Machine, configuring and starting your bot is easy:

1. Create a directory for your Slack Machine bot: `mkdir my-slack-bot && cd my-slack-bot`
2. Add a `local_settings.py` file to your bot directory: `touch local_settings.py`
3. Create a new app in Slack: <https://api.slack.com/apps>
4. Choose to create an app from an _App manifest_
5. Copy/paste the following manifest:

    ``` title="manifest.yaml"
    --8<-- "docs/extra/manifest.yaml"
    ```

6. Add the Slack App and Bot tokens to your `local_settings.py` like this:

    ``` title="local_settings.py"
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-my-app-token"
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-my-bot-token"
    ```

7. Start the bot with `slack-machine`
8. ...
9. Profit!

## Configuring Slack Machine

All the configuration for your bot lives in the `local_settings.py` in the root of your bot directory. The core of
Slack Machine, and the most of the built-in plugins, only need a `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` to function.

You can override the log level by setting `LOGLEVEL`. By default this is set to `"ERROR"`.

!!! warning

    If you set the `LOGLEVEL` to `DEBUG`, all events your Slack App is subscribed to, will be logged.

If you want to use Slack Machine behind a proxy, you can set `HTTP_PROXY`.

### Using environment variables for configuration

For some configuration, it can be a security consideration not to store them in your source code
(i.e. `local_settings.py`) Slack Machine allows you to provide any setting - both built-in and for plugins - as
environment variables. This is done by prefixing the setting name with `SM_`. Example: `SM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and
`SM_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` as environment variable can be used to set the `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` settings
instead of having to put it in the `local_settings.py`.

This way you can follow the [12 Factor app](https://12factor.net/) best practices to configure your bot!

### Setting aliases

The `ALIASES` configuration setting allows the bot to respond to a
trigger symbol instead of a direct @botname.

Example:

If `ALIASES='!,%'` was set in `local_settings.py` then the bot would
respond to the following phrases:

    @botname release the hounds
    !release the hounds
    %release the hounds

### Enabling plugins

Slack Machine comes with a few simple built-in plugins:

- **HelloPlugin**: responds in kind when users greet the bot with
  "hello" or "hi" (only when the bot is mentioned)
- **PingPongPlugin**: responds to "ping" with "pong" and vice
  versa (listens regardless of mention)
- **EchoPlugin**: replies to any message the bot hears, with exactly
  the same message. The bot will reply to the same channel the
  original message was heard in
- **HelpPlugin**: responds to "help" with a list of all available commands and how they work. You can use "robot
  help" to learn the regexes that are used to match commands.
- **MemePlugin**: lets the user generate memes based on templates and captions Uses [Memegen](https://memegen.link/)
- **ImageSearchPlugin**: lets users search images and gifs using Google Custom Search (requires setting up a
  [Programmable Search Engine](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) in Google and adding the
  search engine id as `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and a Google API key as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
- **RBACPlugin**: lets admins assign, revoke and list user roles. Is used when you want to
  [protect commands][protecting-commands]

By default, **HelloPlugin** and **PingPongPlugin** are enabled.

You can specify which plugins Slack Machine should load, by setting the `PLUGINS` variable in `local_settings.py` to
a list of fully qualified classes or modules that contain plugins. You can either point to a plugin class directly, or
to a module containing one or more plugins.

For example, to enable most of the built-in Slack Machine plugins, your `local_settings.py` would look like this:

```python
SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-my-app-token"
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-my-bot-token"
PLUGINS = [
    "machine.plugins.builtin.general.PingPongPlugin",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.general.HelloPlugin",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.debug.EchoPlugin",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.fun.memes.MemePlugin",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.help.HelpPlugin",
]
```

Or is you want import them by the modules they're in:

```python
SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-my-app-token"
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-my-bot-token"
PLUGINS = [
    "machine.plugins.builtin.general",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.debug",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.help",
    "machine.plugins.builtin.fun.memes",
]
```

Slack Machine can load any plugin that is on the Python path. This means you can load any plugin that is installed in
the same virtual environment you installed Slack Machine in. And as a convenience, Slack Machine will also add the
directory you start Slack Machine from, to your Python path.

### Choosing storage

Slack Machine provides persistent storage, which can be used by plugins to store data of any kind. Slack Machine
supports different *backends* for storage, so you can choose one that best fits your needs and existing infrastructure.
You can configure which backend to use, by setting the `STORAGE_BACKEND` variable in `local_settings.py` to the fully
qualified class of the chosen storage backend.

Out of the box, Slack Machine provides 4 options for storage backend:

#### in-memory (*default*)

This backend will store all data in-memory, which is great for testing because it doesn't have any external
dependencies. **Does not persist data between restarts**

*Class*: `machine.storage.backends.memory.MemoryStorage`

#### Redis

Install with: `uv add 'slack-machine[redis]'`

This backend stores data in [Redis](https://redis.io/). Redis is a very fast key-value store that is super easy to
install and operate. This backend is recommended, because it will persist data between restarts. The Redis backend
requires you to provide a URL to your Redis instance by setting the `REDIS_URL` variable in `local_settings.py`. The
URL should have the following format:

    `redis://<host>:<port>[/<db>]`

Where `db` is optional and sets the database number (*0* by default)

Optional parameters:

- `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: maximum number of connections Slack
  Machine can make to your Redis instance
- `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX`: the prefix Slack Machine uses for keys (`SM`
  by default, so "key1" gets stored under `SM:key1`)

*Class*: `machine.storage.backends.redis.RedisStorage`

#### DynamoDB

Install with: `uv add 'slack-machine[dynamodb]'`

This backend stores data in [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL datastore on AWS
that, among other things, allows for easy persistance of objects by key. The DynamoDB backend requires either a set of
valid AWS account credentials, or a locally running DynamoDB test bed, such as the one included in
[localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). This backend requires the environment variables or path-based
AWS credentials that are normally used to access AWS services. The following are optional parameters that can be set in
your `local_settings.py` or `SM_` environment variable slack-machine settings:

Optional parameters:

- `DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT_URL`: specifies an optional alternate endpoint, for local bot testing
- `DYNAMODB_KEY_PREFIX`: an optional prefix to use within the key lookup. Defaults to `SM:`
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME`: specifies the table to use in DynamoDB. Defaults to `slack-machine-state`
- `DYNAMODB_CREATE_TABLE`: optionally -create- the table to be used in DynamoDB. Defaults to `False`
- `DYNAMODB_CLIENT`: if custom configuration is needed for the DynamoDB client, an optional
  [`aioboto3`](https://pypi.org/project/aioboto3/) resource can be specified here

*Class*: `machine.storage.backends.dynamodb.DynamoDBStorage`

#### SQLite

Install with: `uv add 'slack-machine[sqlite]'`

This backend stores data in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight
disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a
non-standard variant of the SQL query language.

The SQLite backend requires you to provide a filename that will be used to store the data by setting the
`SQLITE_PATH` variable in `local_settings.py`. The filename can be relative or absolute:

    `SQLITE_PATH: /path/to/slack-machine.db`

*Class*: `machine.storage.backends.sqlite.SQLiteStorage`

---

So if, for example, you want to configure Slack Machine to use Redis as a storage backend, with your Redis instance
running on *localhost* on the default port, you would add this to your `local_settings.py`:

```python
STORAGE_BACKEND = 'machine.storage.backends.redis.RedisStorage'
REDIS_URL = redis://localhost:6379'
```

That's all there is to it!
