Slack Machine is a simple, yet powerful and extendable Slack bot framework. More than just a bot, Slack
Machine is a framework that helps you develop your Slack workspace into a ChatOps powerhouse. Slack Machine is built
with an intuitive plugin system that lets you build bots quickly, but also allows for easy code organization. A
plugin can look as simple as this:

```python
from machine.plugins.base import MachineBasePlugin
from machine.plugins.message import Message
from machine.plugins.decorators import respond_to


class DeploymentPlugin(MachineBasePlugin):
    """Deployments"""

    @respond_to(r"deploy (?P<application>\w+) to (?P<environment>\w+)")
    async def deploy(self, msg: Message, application, environment):
        """deploy <application> <environment>: deploy application to target environment"""
        await msg.say(f"Deploying {application} to {environment}")
```

## _Breaking Changes_

**Dropped support for Python 3.8** (v0.38.0)

As of [v0.38.0](https://github.com/DonDebonair/slack-machine/releases/tag/v0.38.0), support for Python 3.8 has been
dropped. Python 3.8 has reached end-of-life on 2024-10-07.

## Features

- Get started with mininal configuration
- Built on top of the [Slack Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for smoothly responding
  to events in semi real-time. Uses [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) so your bot doesn't
  need to be exposed to the internet!
- Support for rich interactions using the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web)
- High-level API for maximum convenience when building plugins
- Low-level API for maximum flexibility
- Built on top of [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) to ensure good performance by handling
  communication with Slack concurrently
