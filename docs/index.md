Slack Machine is a wonderful, simple, yet powerful and extendable Slack bot framework. More than just a bot, Slack
Machine is a framework that helps you develop your Slack workspace into a ChatOps powerhouse.

## *Note*

As of v0.30.0 Slack Machine dropped support for the old backend based on the RTM API. As such, Slack Machine is now
fully based on [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). This means plugins written before the
rewrite to asyncio aren't supported anymore. See [here](migrating.md) for a migration guide to get your old plugins
working with the new version of Slack Machine.

It's really easy!

## Features

- Get started with mininal configuration
- Built on top of the [Slack Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for smoothly responding
  to events in semi real-time. Uses [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) so your bot doesn't
  need to be exposed to the internet!
- Support for rich interactions using the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web)
- High-level API for maximum convenience when building plugins
- Low-level API for maximum flexibility
- Built on top of [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) to ensure good performance by handling
  communication with Slack concurrently
