Slack Machine is a simple, yet powerful and extendable Slack bot framework. More than just a bot, Slack
Machine is a framework that helps you develop your Slack workspace into a ChatOps powerhouse. Slack Machine is built
with an intuitive plugin system that lets you build bots quickly, but also allows for easy code organization. A
plugin can look as simple as this:

```python
from machine.plugins.base import MachineBasePlugin
from machine.plugins.message import Message
from machine.plugins.decorators import respond_to


class DeploymentPlugin(MachineBasePlugin):
    """Deployments"""

    @respond_to(r"deploy (?P<application>\w+) to (?P<environment>\w+)")
    async def deploy(self, msg: Message, application, environment):
        """deploy <application> <environment>: deploy application to target environment"""
        await msg.say(f"Deploying {application} to {environment}")
```

## *Note*

As of v0.30.0 Slack Machine dropped support for the old backend based on the RTM API. As such, Slack Machine is now
fully based on [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). This means plugins written before the
rewrite to asyncio aren't supported anymore. See [here](https://dondebonair.github.io/slack-machine/migrating/) for
a migration guide to get your old plugins working with the new version of Slack Machine.

It's really easy!

## Features

- Get started with mininal configuration
- Built on top of the [Slack Events API](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for smoothly responding
  to events in semi real-time. Uses [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) so your bot doesn't
  need to be exposed to the internet!
- Support for rich interactions using the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web)
- High-level API for maximum convenience when building plugins
- Low-level API for maximum flexibility
- Built on top of [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) to ensure good performance by handling
  communication with Slack concurrently

### Plugin API features:

- Listen and respond to any regular expression
- Capture parts of messages to use as variables in your functions
- Respond to messages in channels, groups and direct message conversations
- Respond with reactions
- Respond in threads
- Respond with ephemeral messages
- Send DMs to any user
- Support for [blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks)
- Support for [message attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments) [Legacy üèö]
- Listen and respond to any [Slack event](https://api.slack.com/events) supported by the Events API
- Store and retrieve any kind of data in persistent storage (currently Redis, DynamoDB and in-memory storage are
  supported)
- Schedule actions and messages
- Emit and listen for events
- Help texts for Plugins

### Coming Soon

- Support for Interactive Buttons
- ... and much more

## Installation

You can install Slack Machine using pip:

``` bash
$ pip install slack-machine
```

or add it to your [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) project:

```bash
poetry add slack-machine
```

It is **strongly recommended** that you install `slack-machine` inside a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)!

## Usage

1. Create a directory for your Slack Machine bot: `mkdir my-slack-bot && cd my-slack-bot`
2. Add a `local_settings.py` file to your bot directory: `touch local_settings.py`
3. Create a new app in Slack: <https://api.slack.com/apps>
4. Choose to create an app from an _App manifest_
5. Copy/paste the following manifest: [`manifest.yaml`](docs/extra/manifest.yaml)
6. Add the Slack App and Bot tokens to your `local_settings.py` like this:

    ``` title="local_settings.py"
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN = "xapp-my-app-token"
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN = "xoxb-my-bot-token"
    ```

7. Start the bot with `slack-machine`
8. ...
9. Profit!
